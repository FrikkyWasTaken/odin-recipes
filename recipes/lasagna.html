    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat Oven: Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        Prepare Meat Sauce:
        <ul>
          <li>Heat a bit of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
          <li>Sauté the diced onion and minced garlic until translucent.</li>
          <li>
            Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a spoon, and cook until
            it's browned and no longer pink.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in the crushed tomatoes and Italian seasoning. Season with salt
            and pepper to taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes to combine the flavors,
            then set aside.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix Ricotta Layer:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, beaten egg, grated
            Parmesan, and chopped parsley. Mix well until you have a smooth,
            creamy mixture.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble Lasagna:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of your small
            baking dish to prevent sticking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place a layer of no-boil lasagna noodles over the sauce, breaking
            them as needed to fit the dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle a
            layer of shredded mozzarella on top.
          </li>
          <li>Add another layer of meat sauce over the mozzarella.</li>
          <li>
            Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce), ending
            with a final layer of noodles. Top the last layer of noodles with
            the remaining meat sauce, and sprinkle generously with shredded
            mozzarella and some additional Parmesan cheese.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from
            burning).
          </li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until
            the cheese is bubbly and golden brown on top.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest and Serve:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Let the lasagna sit for a few minutes after taking it out of the
            oven to set, making it easier to cut and serve.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve warm with a side of garlic bread or a green salad for a
            complete meal.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your cozy, homemade small dish lasagna!</p>
