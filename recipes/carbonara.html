    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Carbonara is a beloved Italian pasta dish celebrated for its creamy,
      indulgent sauce made uniquely with eggs, cheese, and the rendered fat of
      pancetta or guanciale, rather than cream. The dish is elegantly simple,
      relying on the quality of its few ingredients, including a generous
      seasoning of freshly cracked black pepper and a sprinkle of Pecorino
      Romano or Parmesan cheese. Its rich, silky texture and savory depth of
      flavor make it a timeless classic in Italian cuisine, embodying the heart
      of comfort food with every twirl of spaghetti.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pasta (traditionally spaghetti) - 400 grams (about 14 ounces)</li>
      <li>Pancetta or Guanciale (diced) - 150 grams (about 5 ounces)</li>
      <li>
        Pecorino Romano cheese (grated) - 1 cup (can substitute or mix with
        Parmesan)
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs - 4 large (often just the yolks are used for extra creaminess)
      </li>
      <li>Freshly cracked black pepper - to taste</li>
      <li>Salt - for pasta water and to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the Pasta:
        <ul>
          <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
          <li>
            Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reserve a cup of pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the Pancetta or Guanciale:
        <ul>
          <li>
            While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the diced pancetta or guanciale to the skillet and cook until
            it's crispy and the fat has rendered, about 3-5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the Eggs and Cheese:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs (or just the yolks if
            preferred) and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined.
            Season with a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine Pasta and Pancetta/Guanciale:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the pancetta or guanciale,
            tossing to combine and ensure the pasta is coated in the rendered
            fat. The residual heat will help to flavor the pasta.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Create the Carbonara Sauce:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Remove the skillet from the heat to prevent the eggs from
            scrambling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta,
            continuously tossing or stirring the pasta to create a creamy sauce.
            The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs gently without scrambling
            them.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the sauce is too thick, gradually add the reserved pasta cooking
            water, a little at a time, until you reach the desired consistency.
            The sauce should be creamy and coat the pasta evenly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Serve the Carbonara immediately, garnished with additional grated
            cheese and a sprinkle of freshly cracked black pepper.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your delicious and authentic Spaghetti Carbonara!</p>
